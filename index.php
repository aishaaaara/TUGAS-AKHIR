           <B> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special<br> treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,<br>
and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br><br>

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.<br>Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
<br><br>
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br>
 so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
